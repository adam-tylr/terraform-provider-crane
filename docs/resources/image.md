# crane_image (Resource)

Push or copy an image to a remote repository. 
		
This resource is designed to support both Terraform and externally managed roll out and roll back of images which means:

- Resource deletion will not delete images or tags from the destination repository. Use lifecycle policies to manage image retention.
- Resource creation will not fail if the image already exists in the destination repository with the same digest.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "crane_image" "example" {
  source      = "alpine:latest"
  destination = "my-registry.local/alpine:latest"
}

resource "crane_image" "from_file" {
  source      = "path/to/local/image.tar"
  destination = "my-registry.local/my-image:latest"
}

resource "crane_image" "mutable_tag" {
  source      = "nginx:latest"
  destination = "my-registry.local/nginx:stable"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `destination` (String) The destination to push the image to (`registry/repo` or `registry/repo:tag`).
- `source` (String) A remote image reference or path to a local docker-style tarball.

### Optional

- `platform` (String) If source is a multi-architecture image, limit copy to a specific platform in the form os/arch[/variant][:osversion] (e.g. linux/amd64). (default all)
- `source_digest` (String) Used to trigger updates for mutable tags. Set using `filemd5` for a local file or the digest function for a remote image.

### Read-Only

- `digest` (String) The digest of the destination image.
- `id` (String) Equivalent to `reference`.
- `reference` (String) The destination image reference including the tag or digest.
